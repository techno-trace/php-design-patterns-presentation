Welcome to the **PHP Design Patterns & SOLID Principles** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of PHP examples demonstrating various design patterns and the SOLID principles.

## üìö Design Patterns

Design patterns are essential for creating robust, scalable, and maintainable code. They provide general reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. Here are some benefits:

- **Factory Pattern:** Simplifies object creation by centralizing it, making the code more manageable and flexible.
- **Specification Pattern:** Enhances flexibility by allowing business rules to be combined in various ways.
- **Adapter Pattern:** Enables incompatible interfaces to work together, promoting reusability.
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:** Decouples request senders from receivers, allowing multiple handlers to process requests flexibly.
- **Decorator Pattern:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Observer Pattern:** Facilitates communication between objects, ensuring changes in one object trigger updates in others.
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access, making it easier to manage and test.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method Pattern:** Defines the program skeleton in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

## üîç SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensures a class has only one reason to change, promoting cohesion.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, enhancing flexibility.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness, ensuring reliable inheritance.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use, promoting decoupling.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions, fostering modularity.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/techno-trace/php-design-patterns-presentation.git
    cd php-design-patterns-presentation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies (if any):**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Run examples:**

    Navigate to the specific pattern or principle directory and run the PHP files to see the examples in action.
